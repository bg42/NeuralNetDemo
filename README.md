# NeuralNetDemo
A demonstration of a simple single-neuron (a.k.a perceptron) neural network in Java

The colors of the dots represent the network's position, with the colors corresponding to the regions (e.g. a blue dot is believed to be in the blue region).
In the program's beginning, dots will be sorted incorrectly quite often but gradually become correctly sorted with greater frequency as the weights settle.
